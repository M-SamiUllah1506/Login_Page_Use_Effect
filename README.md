# React Authentication App

A simple React-based login/logout authentication application using localStorage to persist login state. This project demonstrates fundamental React concepts including state management, conditional rendering, reusable components, form validation, and hooks like `useState` and `useEffect`.

## üöÄ Features

- Login form with basic validation
- Protected content (visible only after login)
- Persistent login state using `localStorage`
- Logout functionality
- Clean and modular component structure

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- React (Functional Components & Hooks)
- CSS Modules for component-scoped styling
- Local Storage API for session persistence



## üß† How It Works

- On loading the app, it checks `localStorage` for a login token.
- If found, it renders the Home component with a welcome message.
- If not logged in, the Login component is shown.
- Email must include "@" and password must be longer than 6 characters to enable the Login button.
- Once logged in, `localStorage.setItem("isLoggedIn", "Logged")` stores the login state.
- On logout, the state is cleared both from React and `localStorage`.
